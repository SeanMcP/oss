## Code of Conduct

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, and to act and interact in
ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy
community.

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Process

This project uses [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to
manage development. At a high level, these steps are:

1. [Create an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue)
   that describes a change that you want to make or identify an existing issue
2. [Open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
   that addresses the issue
3. Maintainers will review the pull request and either approve it or request
   changes
4. Once the pull request is approved, it will be merged by a maintainer
5. Congrats, you're now a contributor!
